I was born in Barcelona in 1977 with my head full of dreams; artist inside but engineer by training. I firmly believe in the beauty of passion.

A lover of technology applied to the visual arts. I enjoy work and life, combining them with creativity and energy. I am a practical and innovative professional, who give many turns to a project until it is perfect from the technical point of view, but able to find that aesthetic detail that makes the difference.

Lover of photography, tireless traveler, dreamer and visionary. I invite you to discover and share my world in these pages. WELCOME!
