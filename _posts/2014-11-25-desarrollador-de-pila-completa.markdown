But what is a full stack developer? My definition is: _A developer with knowledge in all technical layers composing a development solution stack._

I don't mean that this developer must be a master on all layers but being comfortable and familiar with those technologies is a plus.

But then, what is a stack? as defined in [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack): Is a set of software subsystems or components needed to create a complete platform such that no additional software is needed to support applications.

We can take a simple stack structure:

*   [Front end software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_development)
*   [Browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)
*   [Back end software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends)
*   [Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server)/[App](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server) server
*   [Database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)
*   [OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)

A good example of development stack using the structure proposed is LAMP:

*   Front end software: HTML, CSS and Javascript.
*   Browser: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
*   Back end software: PHP (P)
*   Webserver: Apache (A)
*   Database: MySQL (M)
*   OS: Ubuntu Linux (L)

I'd like to point out now a list of terms and technologies that a full stack developer should know. Of course I may have forgotten many other technologies, I cannot list all of them because there are many and many to come in the future.

### System administration

*   Linux and basic shell scripting: Bash, Shell
*   Cloud computing: Amazon, OpenStack, Heroku
*   Background processing: Redis, Gearman
*   Search: Elasticsearch, Sphinx, Solr
*   Caching: Varnish, Memcached, APC
*   Virtualization: Xen, VMware, KVM, Docker
*   Configuration management: Puppet, SaltStack, Chef
*   Monitoring: Nagios, monit, munin, Cacti

### Web development tools

*   Version control: Git, Mercurial, SVN
*   Virtualization: VirtualBox, Vagrant
*   Integrated Development Envirnoment (IDE): Eclipse, Brackets

### Back-end tech

*   Web servers: Apache, Nginx
*   Programming language: PHP, Ruby, Python
*   Programming frameworks: CodeIgniter, NodeJS, Django
*   Database: MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis
*   Continuous integration: Jenkins, Buildbot
*   Syntax: SQL, JSON

### Front-end tech

*   HTML / HTML5: Semantic web
*   CSS / CSS3: LESS, SASS, Media Queries
*   JavaScript: jQuery, AngularJS, Backbone.js
*   Communications: AJAX, WebSocket
*   Syntax: JSON, XML
*   Browser compatibility
*   Responsive design

### Design

*   Converting website design into front-end code (PSD to HTML)
*   User Interface (UI)
*   User Experience (UX)

As an extra, I'd like to add the latest in the mobile world.

### Mobile technologies

*   iOS: Objective-C, Swift
*   Android: Java
*   Hybrid: PhoneGap, Appcelerator, Sencha

## Conclusion

There are many languages, technologies, practises...around software development in a stack structured way. This is the cause why software development teams are so mixed; a only person cannot know all of them at once.

Next time you'll check out a website or slide on your favorite mobile app, you'll remember how many logic and layers are involved.
