I was asked to present the collection [closed curves](http://www.carlessanagustin.com/2012/06/05/curvas-cerradas-2/ "Curvas cerradas") in a private home and this is the result:

TODO
[gallery columns="2" link="file" ids="2022,2023,2024,2025"]

I was looking at various ways of framing the pictures but did not want a frame or glass on top. I believe the frame delimits too much the photo space and glass adds reflections to images, making visibility difficult. After searching for a period I found [Laminamarc](http://www.laminamarc.com/ "Laminamarc"). This is a wooden printing process without frame or glass; perfect for my idea.

Actually I'm very happy with the result and hope to have the opportunity to do more projects like this. I still have many [pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/santopics "Mi flickr") to process and capture many images.
