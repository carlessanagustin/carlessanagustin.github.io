# 4. User

Following this series of "Interactive design for all", I'd like to stop now and write about the user; the one that gives meaning to our interactive interface.

In this section I will explain what I think the user does with our interactive interface as well as the way he/she/it uses the connection terminal. Nowadays we have more than the basic framework; screen, keyboard and mouse. We are in an era of technological progress that allows user interaction in many different ways. I mean not only desktop computers or handsets, but also game consoles, information terminals, digital signage, and a long list of devices and means for the full user experience.

When designing a interactive interface we should brainstorm the purpose of each interaction in order to provide the user with the necessary information using the full potential of the connecting device. As a simple example; as pointer we have tools like a mouse or our fingers, but don't forget about console [gamepads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamepad "Gamepad") or [joystick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joystick "Joystick"), all of them used for pointing purposes.

Next you'll find a list of questions we should have in mind when designing an interactive interface:

*   Pointer type? Mouse, fingers, pen, joystick, ...?
*   How is used? Sitting, lying, in front, ...?
*   Is location important? Such as on the road looking for an address.
*   Are day and time important? Think of live events.
*   What is the purpose of use? Urgent, repetitive, alert, bored, ...?
*   In case of using the [fingers](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1071 "Touch Gesture Reference Guide"); What gestures need to be allowed? In some cases shaking a device can clear the screen of text.
*   What is the [orientation](http://mobiforge.com/developing/story/html5-mobile-web-device-orientation-events "HTML5 for the Mobile Web: Device Orientation Events") of the device? The user may be lying on the couch or standing in the subway.
*   Should we use sounds to help the user experience? If the interface is for an Opera House, I recommend avoiding sounds for live consultations that might disturb the audience.

Currently mobile users are separated in these 4 groups:

*   Lookup/Find: urgent search information.
*   Explore/Play: passing time surfing the net or playing.
*   Check In/Status: repetitive actions to update the status on the Internet.
*   Edit/Create: perform some urgent task that can not wait for the office.

Remember other uses; computer, information panel, game console, ... The more users experience our interface possitively, better reviews and better reputation we get.

In my next post I will talk about the environment where the interfaces are displayed and how this can affect user interaction system.
