After several years using [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/ "Ubuntu") as preferred OS, today I decided to make the switch to [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/ "Linux Mint"). My choice was due to the [Unity](http://unity.ubuntu.com/ "Unity") desktop environment that was frozen at least once a day. I decided for Linux Mint [Cinnamon](http://www.linuxmint.com/rel_olivia_whatsnew.php#cinnamon "Cinnamon") because it is based on [Gnome3](http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/ "Gnome3") and I believe in the technology progress. I think if choosing [MATE](http://www.linuxmint.com/rel_olivia_whatsnew.php#mate "MATE") environment based on [Gnome2](http://www.gnome.org/ "Gnome2") I would remain in the past. For now I am enjoying it very much; as it is Ubuntu based, i can have all my prefered programs using same instructions. I'm still getting used to the bottom panel but I think I will master it shortly.  
I am not saying goodbye to Ubuntu completely. I will keep using its server version as i keep doing with [Red Hat](http://ie.redhat.com/ "Red Hat") and [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/ "CentOS").  
Kind regards.
