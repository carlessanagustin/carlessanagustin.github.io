Recently I had an arm injury that stop my regular swimming. Due to this injury I had to rearrange my sport habits by changing sport; walking and running. I wanted to get more from this activities so I start reading, but how? Audiobooks.

Now I carry on my mobile phone various audiobooks I can listen while practising: [The Power Of Now by Ekhart Tolle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Now "The Power Of Now by Ekhart Tolle"), [Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book) "Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell"), [Bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible "Bible"), [War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace "War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy"), ... You can find many titles on the Internet: [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=nav_shopall_aud_bks?ie=UTF8&node=2402172011 "Amazon Audiobooks"), [OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/freeaudiobooks "OpenCulture Free Audiobooks"), ... so stop saying: I don't have time for reading.

Remember: There is always a way of multitasking when doing repetitive tasks.
