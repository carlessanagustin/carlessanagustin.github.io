I recently attended three days of [Management 3.0](https://management30.com/) and [Workout](https://management30.com/product/workouts/) training of [Jurgen Appelo](http://noop.nl/). I enjoyed the experience of learning and practicing with the latest techniques in managing teams; a much more humane way of working, closer to my values.

The course was taught by professionals such as [Angel Medinilla](http://www.proyectalis.com/en/angelmedinilla/), [Angel Diaz-Maroto](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/adiazmarot) and [Gabriel Prat](http://gabri.io/) who were able to give us the material as well as good examples.

It has also been very helpful to share the course with other professionals and their experiences.
