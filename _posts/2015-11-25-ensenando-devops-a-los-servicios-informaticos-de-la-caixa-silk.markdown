Yesterday I finished the course "[AGILE IT MANAGEMENT: SCRUM, DEVOPS, LEAN IT](http://www.talent.upc.edu/esp/professionals/presentacio/codi/527700/agile/management/scrum/devops/lean)" for Information Services from La Caixa (SILK). In this course I had the pleasure of participating as teacher of [DevOps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) with [Alex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexballarin), [Antonio](http://es.linkedin.com/in/avallesalas) and [Xavier](https://twitter.com/xescuder) who were responsible for Scrum, Lean and Testing respectively.

In this course I included the following topics:

*   Development: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) + [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
*   Integration: [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) + [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/).
*   Deployment: [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) + [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) + [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/).

Thank you very much to all the students for their interest and participation. Thanks also to fellow teachers team to make it happen once again.
