From November 4 I'm working with [Sysdivision](http://sysdivision.com/ "Sysdivision") as project manager. My main role is to coordinate all projects on mobile and web development. At present day Sysdivision is developping web applications in [ruby on rails](http://rubyonrails.org/ "Ruby On Rails"). It also builds native mobile applications for iPhone and Android.

It looks like an interesting and long lasted cooperation. I hope my experience will serve Sysdivision to grow with many customers and more projects.
