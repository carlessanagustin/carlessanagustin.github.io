This April I participated as practices teacher on [Devops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps "DevOps") in the course "[AGILE IT MANAGEMENT: SCRUM, DEVOPS, LEAN IT](http://www.talent.upc.edu/esp/professionals/presentacio/codi/527700/agile/management/scrum/devops/lean "AGILE IT MANAGEMENT: SCRUM, DEVOPS, LEAN IT")" for the [UPC School](http://www.talent.upc.edu/ "UPC School") of Barcelona. Through a [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python") development project I taught attendees the various systems and resources that we can use to pass our software to [producción](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_environment_(software_development_process) "producción"). It was a total of 9 hours over three days in which I structured my practices on DevOps like:

1.  Development: Git, Vagrant, AWS, Redmine.
2.  Integration: Jenkins, Selenium, nose, flake8, pyunit.
3.  Deployment: Puppet, Nagios, Fabric.

These are three key points in the [continuous delivery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery "Continuous Delivery") process. We worked in local, remote and [cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) so that attendees could see the maximum possible cases environments.  
I shared the course with [Alex Ballarín](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexballarin "Alex Ballarín") and [Antonio Valle](http://es.linkedin.com/in/avallesalas "Antonio Valle"). I completed the theory DevOps with their knowledge in [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development) "Scrum") and [Lean IT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_IT "Lean IT"). It was a very enriching experience to participate with them. I hope to do so again soon.
