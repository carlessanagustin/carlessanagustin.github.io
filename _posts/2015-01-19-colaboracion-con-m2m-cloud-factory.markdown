Collaboration with [Oriol Rius](http://oriolrius.cat "Oriol Rius") and his team at [M2M Cloud Factory](http://www.m2mcloudfactory.com/ "M2M Cloud Factory") in the [continuous integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration "continuous integration") process for the [Miimetiq](http://www.m2mcloudfactory.com/en/what-is-miimetiq/content/2 "Miimetiq") framework. This way the team has visibility of the development process and we assure the product quality.  
I have processed the Miimetiq code through [Buildbot](http://buildbot.net/ "Buildbot") steps: deployment, unit and functional testing. For deployment I used [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home "Ansible") and testing has been provided by the development team.

Technologies: Buildbot, Python and Ubuntu.
