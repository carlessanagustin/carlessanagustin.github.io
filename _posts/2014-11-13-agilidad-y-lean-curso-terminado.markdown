I just finished the [Agile and Lean](https://www.miriadax.net/web/agilidad-lean-3edicion/) online course taught by [Javier Garzás](http://www.javiergarzas.com/). Comprehensive course on which not only the methodologies and techniques are learned but also practical examples Javier brings on from his own experience.

The course includes the following modules:

*   Lesson 1: Building software is not like building cars or houses
*   Lesson 2: Peopleware
*   Lesson 3: The Product Owner and user stories
*   Lesson 4: Scrum
*   Lesson 5: Agile Planning
*   Lesson 6: Lean and Kanban
*   Examination

I recommend this course to those who want to learn or improve their use of agile methodologies for software development. I think too, it is a good course to prepare the [Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) and [Lean IT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_IT) certifications.
