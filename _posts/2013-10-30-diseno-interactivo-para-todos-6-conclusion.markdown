# 6. Conclusion

This is the last entry of the series "Interactive design for all". A set of entries I've written to understand the game of interactive interface design. Technology is changing and improving day by day, we must be ready to offer professional services to our users and customers.

Remember the importance of displaying our interface correctly, be prepared for different screen sizes. Please do consider smaller and slower devices, give them the opportunity to visualize our interface without unnecessary overload. Do consider overload in all sides; client-server. Sometimes providing content [gradually](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming) "AJAX") is a good way to prevend terminal saturation due to overload or timeouts.

A good technique to follow is listing all the information to display and classify it according to importance. From this classification our interface can display the appropriate information for each connection scenario. Remember: "[Mobile First](http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first "Mobile First")".

A very important value is user's [privacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy "Internet privacy"). Users are entitled to know personal information use, they must be warned and asked permission. When not having permission, our interface may fail due to lack of capabilities but that's the game, be prepared. One must think before hand what level of interactivity is required; time, resources and knowledge are high economic values for our customers.

Client hardware elements can help us automating tasks and events. But the data we get from these elements must be treated correctly or we may fail due to a lack of precision. Data from a GPS is more precise than a tower triangulation calculation data. I recommend reviewing data accuracy for each element we may use.

A major halt when programming interfaces is compatibility; there are hundreds of OS, browsers and interpreters that process our code following various conventions. Network protocols in a Linux are faster than in WinLows. Not all Internet browsers interpret CSS3 the same way. Due to this compatibility problem, we should be updated on the latest multiplatform technologies. Good examples in web environments are [Modernizer](http://modernizr.com/ "modernizr") or [HTML5 Shiv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Shiv "HTML5_Shiv") libraries. There is not even a consensus on hand gestures for tactile screens.

I hope you enjoyed thse readings. I keep spending time and energy around these concepts so I may write more soon. Do please leave a comment if doubts or notes, I promise answering them. Regards.
