I have been many years believing I was a weirdo for my variety of passions and interests but see I'm not alone. After watching the video, I can say I'm a MULTIPOTENTIALITE:

<div style="max-width:854px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

There are three main "multipotentialite superpowers":

1.  Idea synthesis
2.  Rapid learning
3.  Adaptability

[Here](http://puttylike.com/the-7-multipotentialite-super-powers/) for more about "multipotentialite superpowers".

Because it is not mandatory to specialise in one subject, because it is good to be flexible and be able to learn various topics, because I have no television for more than 10 years ago but I read books and manuals.
