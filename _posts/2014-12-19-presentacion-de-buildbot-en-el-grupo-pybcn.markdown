Yesterday I made a brief introductory presentation to the Python framework [Buildbot](http://buildbot.net/ "Buildbot"). Buildbot is a [continuous integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration "Continuous Integration") tool that I use regularly. I think it may be useful for other development teams and that was my talk purpose. The presentation was shared with [Jordi Soucheiron](https://twitter.com/jordixou "@jordixou") and [Miguel Lechon](https://twitter.com/debiatan "@debiatan") in [Barcelona Python User Group](http://pybcn.org/ "PyBCN").

From here much appreciate the support and interest shown by all attendees. I also like to thank the organisation and presenters. I hope it was interesting and that you use Buildbot for your CI.
